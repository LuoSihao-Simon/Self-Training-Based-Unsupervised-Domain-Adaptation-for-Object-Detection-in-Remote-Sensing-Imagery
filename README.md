# Self-Training-Based-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-for-Object-Detection-in-Remote-Sensing-Imagery
Official PyTorch implementation for TGRS 2024 paper, Self-Training-Based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery

# Coming soon & feel free to ask
There is a lot of work involved in summarising the code and maintaining it, so I need some time ：）. 
If you are interested in this research, you can contact me under this project or by email and I will reply and provide the necessary code or network model in advance.

Note that our project is based on the code of the following three projects，（YOlOv5 Detector， Relation Network and CycleGAN ）and our code will be released soon ：）

# YOlOv5 Detector

# Relation Network
PyTorch code for CVPR 2018 paper: Learning to Compare: Relation Network for Few-Shot Learning

# CycleGAN
